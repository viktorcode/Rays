# Rays
Metal raytracing sample in Swift

This is a direct rewrite of Apple's Objective-C sample in Swift.
Now with millions of rays casted per second counter for rough comparison.

You can get the original sample [here](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metalperformanceshaders/metal_for_accelerating_ray_tracing).
